External Tool Instructions

Paste the resources folder in "ExternalTool\ExternalTool\bin\Debug"

Instructions:

The external tool contains two modes, dungeon creation mode, and room creation mode. To create a room, add the width and height of the room into the text boxes,
you will be taken to a screen with a list and a bunch of black squares. Selecting a texture from the list will show you a preview in the box below the list. From there, you can paint the tile onto any of the spaces.

For the Dungeon creator mode:

When you select the dungeon, you will be shown a grid of buttons and a list of files. Those files are rooms created with the first tool. Selecting a room and clicking a button will change that buttons text to the room name. From there you can save the file. The dungeon file will be read by the game, and displayed onto the level.
