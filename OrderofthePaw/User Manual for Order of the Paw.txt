User Manual for Order of the Paw


For the game to work, you need Visual Studio and MonoGame downloaded onto your system.

When you download the file, you need to extract it, and then go through the folder until you find the Visual Studio solution file for the game.
Once you find it, open it, and then hit ctrl + f5 in order to play the game. The game requires the use of both the keyboard and a mouse, so
make sure you have some form of these enabled before playing the game.

Once the game is up and running, use the mouse to click on any buttons on the screen. When you hit "Play Game", the game automatically starts,
and you control the main character using WASD. To shoot, use the arrow keys to fire in the direction you press. To pause the game, hit the "P"
key. To switch weapons, hit the shift key.

The objective of the game is to give all the dog minions either treats or affection to fend them off and make them go away. Once you clear the
room of all the doggos, you win the game and have been knighted by the Order of the Paw. Losing the game means that you have collided with the
dogs on the screen and have lost all of your health. If you die, you can simply return to the main menu and play the game again.
